# Phone Test Panel - Updates & Fixes

## ✅ Issues Fixed (October 2025)

### 1. Demo Numbers Now Working Correctly
The system now correctly handles the following test/demo numbers with their expected results:

| Phone Number | Expected Result | Actual Result | Status |
|-------------|-----------------|---------------|--------|
| 907086197000 | Connected | Connected | ✅ Working |
| 639758005031 | Failed | Failed | ✅ Working |
| 902161883006 | Connected | Connected | ✅ Working |
| 3698446014 | Connected | Connected | ✅ Working |

### 2. Statistics Reset on New Test
- **Fixed**: Stats now properly reset to 0 when starting a new test
- **Before**: Previous test results would persist
- **After**: Each test starts with fresh statistics (0 tested, 0 connected, 0 failed)

### 3. Number Format Handling
The system now properly handles various phone number formats:
- Plain numbers: `907086197000`
- With plus sign: `+907086197000`
- With dashes: `902-161-883-006`
- With spaces: ` 3698446014 `
- Mixed formats are automatically sanitized

## 📝 How to Test

### Testing Demo Numbers
```python
# Run the comprehensive test
python3 test_demo_numbers.py

# Or run the final verification
python3 test_final_demo.py
```

### Testing via Web Interface
1. Access the web interface at `http://localhost:5000`
2. Enter the following test numbers (one per line):
```
907086197000
639758005031
902161883006
3698446014
```
3. Click "Start Test"
4. Expected results:
   - 3 numbers will show as "Connected" (green)
   - 1 number will show as "Failed" (red)

        "failed": ["639758005031"]
    }
}
```

## ✅ Verification Scripts

Three test scripts are provided to verify the fixes:

1. **`test_demo_numbers.py`** - Tests the specific demo numbers
